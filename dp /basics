// dynamic programming 
those how forget the past are contempt to repeat it  
  // dp means learn from past means jo ek baar calculate kar chukka ho donot calculate it again 

  // 1 appraoch top down approach - in this approach we are just using the recursion we just added one new thing that is memoisation 
  // 2 buttom up approach - this is called tabulation method , in this there is now recursion we solve the questions in iterative way 
  // 3 we will check that optimisation in space is possible or not 




  
when to apply the dp when these both of the conditions gets satisfed 
  1) overlapping sub problem - means if u take out f(6) for the first time then no need to take it out again 
  2) optimal sub problem - optimal solution of the bigger problem can be calculated by using the optimal solution of the smaller problem 

// if the value of 1 paramter change in dp then it is called the 1 dp 
// if the value of 2 parameter change in dp then it is called the 2 dp
